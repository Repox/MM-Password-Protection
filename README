*Simple password protection addon for MojoMotor*

Installation:
Create the folder system/mojomotor/third_party/password
Copy contents into system/mojomotor/third_party/password

You're done.

Usage:
Create/edit a layout and put this as the first line:
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser" password="mypassword"}
This will initiate a basic HTTP authentication.
Failing to login, will show the general error page.

You can add more users by seperating usernames and passwords with a comma.
Like this:
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser,user2" password="mypassword,user2pass"}
Just make sure you have the same amount of usernames and passwords.

If you need to change the basic realm, just add an attribute named realm:
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser" password="mypassword" realm="Customer Site"}

If you'd like to change the text in the error message, just use the heading and message attributes
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser" password="mypassword" realm="Customer Site" heading="Stay Away!" message="You are not allowed here!"}

*Troubleshooting*
PHP Running as CGI:
To make this addon work for PHP running as CGI you need to create a .htaccess file in the document root (where index.php is).
Also, mod_rewrite needs to be enabled for Apache.
The .htaccess file should contain the following two lines:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [E=REMOTE_USER:%{HTTP:Authorization},L]

That should do the trick.
