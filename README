Simple password protection addon for MojoMotor

Installation:
Copy everything into system/mojomotor/third_party
You're done.

Usage:
Create/edit a layout and put this as the first line:
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser" password="mypassword"}
This will initiate a basic HTTP authentication.
Failing to login, will show the general error page.

You can add more users by seperating usernames and passwords with a comma.
Like this:
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser,user2" password="mypassword,user2pass"}
Just make sure you have the same amount of usernames and passwords.

If you need to change the basic realm, just add an attribute named realm:
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser" password="mypassword" realm="Customer Site"}

If you'd like to change the text in the error message, just use the heading and message attributes
{mojo:password:protect username="myuser" password="mypassword" realm="Customer Site" heading="Stay Away!" message="You are not allowed here!"}
